README generate_logos.rb

This script uses the attributes in the entities to generate svg logos. It generates them in the simple_token style, but may be used as primary tokens where a primary token is not available.

To use the script, first add paths to the logos in the entities. Review another game with tokens and/or simple tokens for an example. Add a new folder in public/logos for the new game if there is not one already.

Run the development docker container. In a terminal window, enter the following to get a Ruby prompt:

docker compose exec rack rake dev_irb

Then in Ruby, enter (for 1849, for example):

require_relative('scripts/generate_logos')

generate_logos('1849', simple=true, overwrite=false, minors=false)

Usage:
simple=true is for alt-logos if you have proper SVG logos, whereas simple=false (or leave simple out altogether) will generate the main logos
