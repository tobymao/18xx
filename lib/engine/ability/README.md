# Abilities

This page documents the different ability types and the attributes which may be
set for each type.

Abilities are mainly used to describe private company powers, but may also apply
to other entities such as corporations. Examples of how their use can be seen in
the [game configuration directory](../config/game).

## Generic attributes

These attributes may be set for all ability types.

- `after_phase`: The ability is active for all phases after the specified phase.
- `count`: The number of times the ability may be used.
- `count_per_or`: The number of times the ability may be used in each OR; the
  property `count_this_or` is reset to 0 at the start of each OR and increments
  each time the ability is used.
- `on_phase`: The phase when this ability is active.
- `owner_type`: The company must be owned by this type of entity in
  order for the ability to be active. Either "player" or
  "corporation".
- `remove`: Game phase when this ability is removed.
- `type`: The name of the ability type.
- `use_across_ors`: If `count` is more than 1 and this is `false`, then the
  ability may only be used within one OR; if an OR starts and the ability has
  been used at least once, but there is still `count` remaining, the ability
  gets used up and removed. Default `true`.
- `when`: (string or array of strings) The game steps or special time descriptor
  when this ability is active. If no values are provided, this ability is
  considered to be "passive", i.e., its effect applies without the user needinng
  to click on the abilities button to activate it. For an ability to be included
  in an `abilities()` call, either a `time` kwarg or the name of the current
  game phase class must match (one of) the ability's `when` string(s). Examples:
    - `any`: usable at any time during the game.
    - `bought_train`: when the owning corporation has bought a train; generally
      used with `close` abilities.
    - `buying_train`: train buying step.
    - `has_train`: when the owning corporation owns at least one train.
    - `never`: use with `close` abilities to prevent a company from closing.
    - `operated`: when the owning corporation has finished the dividend step
      on their first turn.
    - `or_between_turns`: usable at the start of any corporation's OR turn,
      before that corporation has acted.
    - `owning_corp_or_turn`: usable at any point during the owning corporation's OR turn.
    - `owning_player_or_turn`: usable at any point during any of the owning player's
      OR turns.
    - `owning_player_sr_turn`: usable at any point during any of the owning player's
      SR turns.
    - `owning_player_track`: usable during track step during any of the owning player's
      OR turns.
    - `route`: running routes step.
    - `sold`: when the company is bought from a player by a corporation.
    - `special_track`: `SpecialTrack` step when it blocks for a private company
      that gets multiple lays.
    - `stock_round`: usable any time during a Stock Round.
    - `token`: token-placing step.
    - `track`, `track_and_token`: track-laying step; if normal track lays are used
      up, but there is still a `Track` ability, then the active step will not
      pass on to the next step automatically.

## acquire_company

This company comes with a company when acquired.

- `company`: The sym of the additional company to be acquired.

## additional_token

Adds 'count' additional tokens to a purchasing company (1817)

## assign_corporation

Designate a specific corporation to be the beneficiary of the ability,
for example Steamboat Company in 1846.

When a company with this ability is sold to a corporation, the company is
automatically assigned to the new owning corporation.

- `closed_when_used_up`: This ability has a count that is decreased each time
 it is used. If this attribute is true the private is closed when count reaches
 zero, if false the private remains open but the discount can no longer be used.
 Default false.

With this configuration, the automatic assignment will happen and the company
cannot be further reassigned:

```
{
  "type": "assign_corporation",
  "when": "sold",
  "count": 1,
  "owner_type": "corporation"
}
```
- `count`: The number of times the ability may be used.

## assign_hexes

Designate a hex to the ability. Usually simulates placement of a special power token.

- `hexes`: An array of hex coordinates where this ability may be used.

## blocks_hexes

Designate hexes which are blocked by this ability. Use the `owner_type: "player"`
to specify that the blocking ends when the company is bought in by a corporation.

- `hexes`: An array of hex coordinates that are blocked.

## blocks_hexes_consent

Designate hexes which are blocked by this ability. Use the `owner_type:
"player"` to specify that the blocking ends when the company is bought in by a
corporation. However unlike `blocks_hexes` this doesn't block the ability except
through a front end confirmation, so players (if they click through) are allowed
to lay a tile on this hex. This is just like when purchasing a train from
another player.

- `hexes`: An array of hex coordinates that are blocked.

## blocks_partition

Designate a type of partition which this ability disallows crossing.
A partition separates an hex in 2 halves. Use the `owner_type: "player"`
to specify that the blocking ends when the company is bought in by a
corporation.

- `partition_type`: The name of the partition type that is to be
  blocked, akin to terrain and border types.

## borrow_train

May borrow a train from the Depot for running trains when trainless.

- `train_types`: Array of train types that are eligible for borrowing.

## close

Describe when the company closes, using the `when` attribute.

- `corporation'`: If `when` is set to `"train"`, this value is the name
  of the corporation whose train purchase closes this company.

## description

Provide a description for an ability that is implemented outside of the ability
framework.

- `description`: Description of the ability.

## exchange

This company may be exchanged for a single share of a specified corporation
during a step that allows exchange.

- `corporations`: An array with corporation names, whose share may be exchanged.
  Use a simple `"any"` (no array) to allow for any corporation. Use a simple
  `"ipoed"` (no array) to allow from any company that has been IPOed.
- `from`: Where the share may be take from, either `"ipo"`, `"market"`, or an
  array containing both.

## hex_bonus

Give a route bonus if at least one of the hexes are included in the route.

- `amount`: Revenue bonus.
- `hexes`: Name of hexes that gives a bonus.

## no_buy

This company may not be bought in.

## purchase_train

Immediately purchases the currently available depot train for the owning corporation.
- `free`: If true, the train cost is free, otherwase at cost. Default false.

## reservation

Reserve a token slot.

- `city`: Which city to reserve, if multiple cities are on one hex.
- `hex`: Hex coordinate.
- `slot`: A specific token slot to designate.

## return_token

Take a station token off the board and place back on the charter
in the most expensive open location.

- `reimburse`: If true, the corporation is reimbursed the token cost of the
  location where the token is placed.

## revenue_change

The revenue for this company changes when the conditions set by `when`
and `owner_type` are satisfied.

- `revenue`: The new revenue value.

## sell_company

This company can be sold to bank for face value. This closes the company.

## shares

This company comes with a share of a corporation when acquired.

- `corporations`: A list of corporations to be used with `"share": "random_share"`
- `share`: If a string in the form of `sym_x`, where `sym` is a
  corporation symbol, and `x` is a numeric index, gives the
  certificate of the corporation at index `x` (`x = 0` is the
  president's certificate). If `"random_president"`, gives a
  president's certificate randomly selected at game setup. Gives one
  ordinary share of one the corporations listed in `corporations`,
  randomly selected at game setup.

## teleport

Lay a tile and place a station token without connectivity.

- `cost`: Cost to use the teleport ability.
- `extra_action`: If true, this ability may be used in addition to the turn's
  normal token placement step. Default false.
- `free_tile_lay`: If true, the tile is laid with 0 cost. Default false.

  just the owner (1817 Mountain Engineers).
- `terrain`: Terrain type for this ability.

## tile_lay

Lay or upgrade one or more track tiles without connectivity, in addition to
normal tile lay actions.

- `blocks`: If true and `when` is `sold`, then the step `TrackLayWhenCompanySold`
  will require a tile lay. Default false.
- `closed_when_used_up`: This ability has a count that is decreased each time it
  is used. If this attribute is true the private is closed when count reaches
  zero, if false the private remains open but the discount can no longer be used.
  Default false.
- `connect`: If true, and `count` is greater than 1, tiles laid must connect to
  each other. Default true unless `count_per_or` is used, in which case `connect`
  isn't checked by default.
- `consume_tile_lay`: If true, using this private counts as a corporations tile
  lay and must follow lay/upgrade rules. Upgrade's also count towards the
  corporations 'upgrade' lays. Default false.
- `count_per_or`: used if private ability limits the amount of tile lays that
  you can use per OR.
- `cost`: Cost to use the ability.
- `discount`: Discount the cost of laying the tile by the given
  amount. Default 0.
- `free`: If true, the tiles are laid with 0 cost. Default false.
- `hexes`: Array of hex coordinates where tiles may be laid.
- `lay_count` and `upgrade_count` - Use as an alternative to `count`. `lay_count`
  is the number of yellow tile lays, and `upgrade_count` is the number of green
  or higher tile upgrades. When these are set, the ability cannot be used for
  both new tile lays and upgrades. With these set, you need to make sure the
  `ability.use!` call includes an `upgrade` kwarg.
- `must_lay_all`: If true and `count` is greater than 1 and `must_lay_together`
  is true, all the tile lays must be used; if false, then some tile lays may be
  forfeited. Default false.
- `must_lay_together`: If true and `count` is greater than 1, all the tile lays
  must happen at the same time. If this is `true`, you might want `when` to
  include `special_track`. Default false.
- `reachable`: If true, when tile laid, a check is done if one of the
  controlling corporation's station tokens are reachable; if not a game
  error is triggered. Default false.
- `special`: If true, do not check that the tile upgrade preserves labels and
  city count. Default true.
- `tiles`: Array of tile numbers which may be laid.

## token

Modified station token placement.

- `cheater`: If an integer is given, this token will be placed into a city at
  whichever is the lowest unoccupied slot index of the following: a regular slot
  in the city; the `cheater` value; one slot higher than the city actually has,
  effectively increasing the city's size by one. (See 18 Los Angeles's optional
  company "Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe" or the corporations which get removed in
  1846 2p Variant for examples). Default nil.
- `check_tokenable`: If false, skip the `tokenable?` check before placing the
  token. Used in 18LA2 for the Angeles Public Dump, which places a special
  station token that does not actually belong to the owning corporation, and can
  therefore be placed in the same city as another token belonging to the owning
  corporation. Note that this property will bypass all tokenable checks, not
  just `:existing_token`. Default true.
- `city`: Index of the city on the hex where this ability may be used, if
  multiple cities are there.
- `connected`: If true, when token placed, a check is done if the desired token
  slot is connected by track with another city that has a token of the
  corporation; if not a game error is triggered. Default false.
- `discount`: ratio discount from the normal price, e.g., `0.25` takes 25% off
  the token price.
- `extra_action`: If true, this ability may be used in addition to the turn's
  normal token placement step. Default false.
- `extra_slot`: Simlar to `cheater` except this token does not take a slot -
  When `cheater` is used, when the city gets an extra city slot the 'cheater'
  token goes into the newly opened slot. If `extra_slot` is used, when the city
  gets an extra token slot, the new token slot is open - the extra token does
  not consume it. This also means that an `extra_slot` token lay in an city with
  an open slot does not use up the open slot.
- `from_owner`: If true, this ability uses a token from the owning corporation's
  charter; if false, an additional token is created. Default false.
- `hexes`: Array of hex coordinates where this ability may be used.
- `neutral`: If true, this ability uses a "neutral" token, which allows all
  corporations to pass through it.
- `price`: Price for placing token.
- `special_only`: If true, this ability may only be used by explicitly.
  activating the company to which it belongs (i.e., using the `SpecialTrack`
  step); if unset or false, `Engine::Step::Tokener#adjust_token_price_ability!`
  infers that the special ability ought to be used whenever a token is being
  placed in a location that the ability is allowed to use. Default false.
- `teleport_price`: If present, this ability may be used to place a
  token without connectivity, for the given price.
- `same_hex_allowed`: If `true`, a token may be placed on a hex where the owning
  corporation already has a token in a different city.

## train_buy

Modify train buy in some way.

- `face_value`: If true, any inter corporation train buy must be at
  face value. Default false.

## train_discount

Discount the train buy cost. The `count` attribute specify how many times the
discount can be used.

- `closed_when_used_up`: This ability has a count that is decreased each time it
  is used. If this attribute is true the private is closed when count reaches
  zero, if false the private remains open but the discount can no longer be used.
  Default false.
- `discount`: Discount amount. If > 1 this is an absolute amount.
  If 0 < amount < 1 it is the fraction, e.g. 0.75 is a 75% discount.
- `trains`: An array of all train names that the discount applies to.

## train_limit

Modify train limit in some way.
For performance reasons, the supporting code needs to be added directly to the
game class. See G18MEX#train_limit for an example.

- `increase`: If positive, this will increase the train limit with this
  amount in all faces. Default 0.
