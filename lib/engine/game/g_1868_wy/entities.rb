At phase 5, the exchange (and capitalization) happens automatically, but no immediate sale is allowed. If P11 is unsold in the initial auction, UP may issue the 20% cert or players may buy it even if other shares are in UP's treasury. If the 20% cert is in the bank pool, UP may not redeem it, and players may only buy it if it is the last available UP certificate. If the UP presidency is dumped on the holder of the 20% cert holder, they may choose to exchange the 20% cert or two 10% certs for the president's cert. If they don't have two 10% certs, and there are sufficient shares in the bank pool, they may immediately buy shares from the bank pool (at the price UP was when the previous president sold) until they have two 10% certs, and then exchange those for the president's certificate. Shares bought in that way effectively subtract from the number of shares sold by the previous president, which may reduce the number of net rows the UP stock price drops due to the previous president's sale.",
