      # PassableAuction adds logic on top of Auctioner.
      # It assumes that one item is up for auction (set by selection_bid)
      # It assumes that once a entity has passed they are now out of that auction until it is resolved.
      # When only one entity remains it calls resolve_bids and win_bid
      # @auctioning - Current 'company' being auctioned
      # @active_bidders - List of entities that have yet to pass on the auction
      # @auction_triggerer - Who triggered the auction
