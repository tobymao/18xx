**What's your Game ID?**

<!--
DO NOT PASTE THE GAME JSON! Please use [gist](https://gist.github.com/) instead.

If your game is "Multiplayer", provide the link to the game. Copy the link from your browser which will look something like `https://18xx.games/game/31337`

- (optional) Provide a link to the specific action that triggered the bug using the `Game` tab and `History` navigation arrows. Copy the resulting link from your browser which will look something like `https://18xx.games/game/31337?action=42`

If your game is "Hotseat", provide a link to your raw game data by using the `Tools` tab and `Copy Game Data`.

Paste that data [into a github gist](https://gist.github.com/) and share the resulting link which will look something like `https://gist.github.com/[your_name]/[some_letters]`.

**How to Reproduce the Bug?**

<!--
What steps cause the unexpected behavior?

e.g.
- During Operating Round 2.1 the B&O ran a 2 train from Baltimore to DC
- B&O has a token in Baltimore, and both cities are yellow tiles
- Revenue was less than the $60 that I expected

Please include screenshots (you can drag and drop or upload them into this issue)
